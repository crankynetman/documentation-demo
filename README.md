# Making Documentation Less Painful

IMPORTANT: If you are stumbling across this, you should read [this](https://slash64.tech) blog post first.

This is a simple demo of how I use git and draw.io for documentation. typically I will have a README.md page in the root of the Repo that just describes the purpose of a documentation repository. For a small organization, one repository with sub-folders for each system/group of systems will do the trick.

## Network Documentation

## Systems and Network Monitoring Documentation
