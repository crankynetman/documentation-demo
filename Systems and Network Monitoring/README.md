# Monitoring Documentation

## Overview

All good IT infrastructure has monitoring and alerting. All great IT infrastructure documents how things are monitored! In this demo network, monitoring is performed by LibreNMS which sends alerts to PagerDuty to let whoever is on call know that something is broken.

## LibreNMS

LibreNMS was chosen as the NMS for this demo because I felt like it. Isn't that a solid reason for choosing a tool?

Details on the LibreNMS implementation are [here](LibreNMS/).

## PagerDuty

PagerDuty was chosen for alerting just because. Look, writing documentation is hard enough, writing it for a blog post about an imaginary network? You have to cut me some slack.

Details on our PagerDuty implementation are [here](PagerDuty/).
